<p class="project-tagline">After almost seven years working with Sitecore, I decided to start a small project which the primary purpose&nbsp;is to create a set of improvements&nbsp;for the Sitecore user interface that I realized that could be useful for developers and content editors.&nbsp;I have a list of features that I would like to develop during the next months, and I planned to deliver at least one per month.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="project-tagline">This project is an open source project available at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/andresvillenas/Sitecore.Extensions">https://github.com/andresvillenas/Sitecore.Extensions</a>.&nbsp;Currently, this project is under development, and it is not available in <a href="https://marketplace.sitecore.net/" target="_blank">Sitecore Marketplace</a> yet. However, there is already a single feature developed completely: JumpList.</p>
<h3 class="project-tagline"><a href="https://andresvillenas.github.io/Sitecore.Extensions/features/jumplist/JumpList.html">JumpList</a></h3>

<section class="main-content">
<p>This component for the&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.sitecore.com/users/90/sitecore-experience-platform/en/the-content-editor.html">Sitecore Content Editor</a>&nbsp;that allows adding a shortcut of an item at the top of the content tree of the content editor. It helps to access quickly the items that you have worked recently.</p>
<h4 id="main-features">Main features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allows adding a shortcut of an item using the context menu.</li>
<li>The shortcut opens the item and expands the content tree to show the position of the item.</li>
<li>If an item is renamed, the shortcuts are updated with the new name.</li>
<li>If an item is deleted, the shortcut is also removed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's next?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Publish item in the context menu</em> feature.</li>
<li>Publication of the module to the Sitecore Marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for today.</p>
<p>Until the next post!</p>
